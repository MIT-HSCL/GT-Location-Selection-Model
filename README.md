# Gene Therapy Treatment Center Location Selection Model
This model was developed for a specific product in Brazil, but could be used for other products or locations. 
See my thesis: "Looking at the Map, Together: Modeling Treatment Center Location Selection and its Effects on Access to Gene Therapy in Brazil" (soon to be on MIT DSpace) for more details.

### This GT-Location-Selection-Model repository contains:

1. Jupyter/Colab Notebook with the model
2. Data files needed to run the model for Brazil:
   1. Five candidate center location .csv files
   2. A treatment start points .csv file
   3. Two population .csv files
3. Slides summarizing some information about the project and results, in both .pptx and .pdf file formats
